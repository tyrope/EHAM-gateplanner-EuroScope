EHAM Gateplanner Plugin for Euroscope
--
This plugin is written for EHAM controllers on the VATSIM network, specifically those in positions of GND and higher.

The main purpose of this plugin is to contact the web-based gateplanner and inform the Controller of the assigned gate inside Euroscope, however other features are planned (see [docs/moscow.txt](https://github.com/tyrope/EHAM-gateplanner-EuroScope/blob/master/docs/moscow.txt) and the [issues page](https://github.com/tyrope/EHAM-gateplanner-EuroScope/issues))

This readme will be expanded as the plugin gets closer to the initial beta-release version.
